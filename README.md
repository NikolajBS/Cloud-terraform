OBJECTIVES:

Create group GCP project.✅
Create a Google Cloud Source Repository git repo and use it for the project together.✅

Fork this project to your own repositories and work in those together for the rest of the steps.✅

Invite team members to the project with relevant IAM roles assigned.✅

Create Terraform landing zone (initialize Terraform, connect with GCP backend) use Terraform for the next steps where it makes sense.✅

Create build pipeline for frontend and backend applications.✅

Change frontend app so that the backend address comes from configuration.✅

Deploy frontend application to Storage Bucket with web settings and publish it with CDN.✅

Deploy backend application to Cloud Run.✅

Create Cloud SQL MySQL instance.✅

Create connection between Cloud Run backend and the deployed MySQL instance.✅

Implement centralised logging and alerting on key metrics for the whole stack. 

Create detailed report about architecture and implementation choices. Include what you have learned from the leactures, industry talks, Terraform sessions and Google Cloud lectures and labs. Include your own considerations, and the different ways you tried to implement the objectives, and which worked and which did not. If you were not able to implement something with Terraform, list it, and give an explanation why, and how you did it in the end.

Write a summary of the main steps of your implementation to the README.md file under STEPS OF IMPLEMENTATION. Consider only the final solution's steps (don't include everything you tried, just what you hand in, so we can easily have an overview of your solution).
